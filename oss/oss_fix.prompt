Goal: Implement a minimal FIX that makes the repro test pass.
Rules:
- Follow style/lint rules from context.md (Rubocop/ESLint/etc).
- Keep change small; avoid drive-by refactors.
- Add/adjust tests; include edge cases.
- Provide a diff (paths + code) suitable for a PR.
- Note any migration/compat implications.
