Goal: REPRODUCE the reported bug without changing code.
Produce:
- Exact environment/version assumptions.
- Minimal steps to reproduce.
- A failing test (file path + spec snippet) or script.
- Captured logs/errors.
Do not propose a fix yet; we want a failing test first, aligned to project's test framework from context.md.
